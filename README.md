# TrafficLightSystemRL-DLW2022-VAlly
This repository contains codes for AATLaS, the Auto-Adaptive Traffic Light System to optimize traffic flow from every junction of Singapore. This is a project for the DLW Hackaton 2022 hosted by MLDA@EEE.

## Problem statement
<p align="center"> <img src="controlling/Sample_Grid.png"/> </p>
Consider the problem: we have a busy crossroad with 4 traffic light clusters. We have traffic camera(s) that can give us information about the direction each car is travelling. What is the optimal green-light time for each travelling direction at the crossroad?

## Approach
TLS utilizes the data from the camera(s) to perform 2 steps:

1. Using the camera data, infer the traffic flow for each of the 12 possible travelling directions at the crossroad.
2. From the traffic flow, calculate the optimal green-light time for one of the two sides of the crossroad.

The first step is performed with a deep neural network model for object detection and tracking. The second step is performed with a deep reinforcement learning model to calculate the green-light time.

## Training
For step 1, we refered to this paper "Zero-VIRUS: Zero-shot VehIcle Route Understanding System for Intelligent Transportation"<sup>[1]</sup>, and used transfer learning to re-trained the model with our custom dataset.

For step 2, we first created SUMO simulation based on real-life traffic data. For the model, we built a Deep Q-Network. We then train the model in that simulated environment. The model was trained in 10 epochs with 200 steps.

## Result
Lost function of the controlling model (total waiting time at crossroad):
